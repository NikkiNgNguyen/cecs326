# Reading and Writing Integers with shared memory

Compile, test, and study the following c++ programs. (also available in the content section) Run 1_reader.out first so that it can create the queue and wait for inputs, then run the 2_writer.out which will receive user inputs and write them as short integers to shared memory.  Inputting a negative value into the 2_writer.out program will cause the both programs to terminate and close the shared memory region.
