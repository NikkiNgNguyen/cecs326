## Instructions

### RelationalOperation.asm

Write a NASM program that will:
    prompt the user to enter a numerical digit
        the numerical digit will then be stored in variable1
    prompt the user to enter another numerical digit
        the second numerical digit will then be stored in variable2
    The relationship between the digits ( variable1 > variable2, variable1 == variable2, variable1 < variable 1)will then be indicated by a message that will be printed to standard output
    Sample program runs are shown below with user input shown in bold:

### Example of when  variable1 > variable2
```
Please enter a digit: 1

Please enter a second digit: 2

1 is greater than 2
```
### Example of when  variable1 == variable2
```
Please enter a digit: 1

Please enter a second digit: 1

1 is equal to 1
```
### Example of when  variable1 < variable2
```
Please enter a digit: 2

Please enter a second digit: 1

2 is less than 1
```
For starter code please see the example program covered in class: [CompareBytesNASM](https://bbcsulb.desire2learn.com/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=502447&type=content&rcode=CSULB-2229878)

Refer to [pcasm-book](https://bbcsulb.desire2learn.com/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=502447&type=content&rcode=CSULB-2224147) section 2.2 for Control Structures and chapter 4 subprograms

Also Refer to  previous lecture example: [01_NASM_Lec0](https://bbcsulb.desire2learn.com/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=502447&type=content&rcode=CSULB-2227228) to see how to embed a variable into a string.
